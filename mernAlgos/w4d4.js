/* 
  Create a function to determine the max amount of
  servings that can be made based on a recipe and
  available ingredients.
  Input:
    - recipe object where keys are ingredient names
      and values are unit required (int)
    - available ingredients object where keys are ingredient
      names and values are unit available (int)
  Output:
    int (max servings)
  Side note (not needed for solution): Realistically, the values
  would be an object as well with the keys: unit (unit of measure), and amount.
  If the available ingredient was stored in a different unit,
  a conversion table would be needed to convert units of measure.
